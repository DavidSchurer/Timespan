Assignment 2: Timespan

Design and implement a TimeSpan class which represents a duration in hours, minutes and seconds.

Displayed     Meaning
2:12:07       2 hours, 12 minutes, 7 seconds
-0:10:43      minus 10 minutes and 43 seconds

The seconds and minutes must be between 0 and 59. The hours can be 0 to any number.
When TimeSpan is printed, the minutes and seconds should always have 2 digits.

The constructor for TimeSpan can take 0, 1, 2, or 3 parameters. In addition to integer values, the
constructor should also be able to handle double values and convert them as accurately as possible.

TimeSpan(1.5, -10, 93)  same as 1:21:33
TimeSpan(1.5)           same as 1:30:00

Implement the following operators to work with TimeSpan:
1. Displaying: operator<<
2. Equality: operator==, operator!=
3. Comparison: operator>, operator<, operator>=, operator<=
4. Addition/Subtraction: operator+, operator-, operator+=, operator-=
5. Integer Multiplication

Integer multiplication allows us to multiply a TimeSpan with an integer and is not commutative.
The other operators work on two given TimeSpan values and are commutative.
